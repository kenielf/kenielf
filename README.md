- Hi, I'm Kenielf! Feel free to call me by my actual name as well, which is Chrystian.
- As of writing this, I'm a third year student that's learning more and more about computer science, I'll be using this github profile
to set up my repos, whether they'll be for study, personal use or anything else is something I've yet to decide.
- If you'd like to contact me professionally, please do so by messaging my email: chrystianfranklin.profissional@gmail.com
